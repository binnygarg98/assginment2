<h1>Interneting is easy!</h1>
<p>First we need to learn some html!<p>
<h2>Headings</h2>
<p> Headings define the outline of your site.there are six levels of heading<p>
<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>this  is how you make an unordered list</p>
<ul>
<li> Add a ul element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
<li> add each  item in its own h elelemnt</li>
<li> they ddont need to be in any particular order</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what ana ordered list looks like</p>

<ol>
<li> Notice the new "ol" elemnt wrapping everything</li>
<li>But the list item elemn=ents are the same</li>
<li>Also note how the no. increment on their own</li>
<li>You should notice things in precise order ,because this is an ordered list</li>

<h2>Inline Elements</h2>

<p><i>Sometimes</i>, you need  need to draw attention to a particular group or phrase</p>

<em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout</strong></em>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>
